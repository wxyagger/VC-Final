                <p class="text-left" style="font-size: calc(.3vw + .3vh + 1vmin); padding-bottom: 3vh;">This video was created for an exercise in gently insisting on breaks during (long and short, boring or intense) Zoom meetings, as a collaboration between Karlin Boelens-van der Klink (WdKA Vitality Coach) and WdKA Social Practices.The mechanics for its use are simple. In a regular work meeting, every 30mins, a Vitality Zoombomber crashes the meeting and, without saying a word, takes over screenshare functions to play ths video. Meeting participants should be gently briefed on the exercuse when the work session begins, ideally even meeting the Vitality Zoombomber briefly over auto only (everyone else can have their cameras on). Vitality Zoombomber is not part of the workgroup and exits the meeting after the audio introductoin.
